## Overview

This practice demonstrates how to:

- Create string variables
- Combine two string values
- Store the combined value in another variable
- Display the result using a Label control

---

## 1. Creating Variables

In this step, three string variables are created to store the user's name information:

- `FirstName` - stores the first name
- `SecondName` - stores the second name
- `FullName` - stores the complete name after combining the first and second names.

The following screenshot shows how the variables are declared in C#.

```csharp
string FirstName, SecondName, FullName;

```

## 2. Concatenating the First Name and Second Name

In this step, the first name and second name are combined using the `+` operator.

A space `" "` is added between the two names so that the final result is displayed correctly.

The result is stored in the `FullName` variable.

The following screenshot shows the string concatenation process.

## 3. Displaying the Full Name

After the first name and second name are combined, the value stored in `FullName` is displayed in a Label control.

The `.Text` property of the label is used to show the result on the Windows Form.

The following screenshot shows how the full name is displayed.
